      "A comprehensive introduction to the field of System-on-Chip design.  Introduces basic concepts of digital system modeling and simulation methodologies.  Various types of hardware description language (HDL) will be studied, including Verilog, VHDL, and SystemC.  Topics include top-down and bottom-up design methodology, specification language syntax and semantics, RTL, behavioral and system-level modeling, and IP core development.  Included are three projects on hardware modeling and simulation.",
      "Introduction to the basic concepts of mobile cloud computing, including 1. The mobile computing technology used in modern smart phones; 2. The cloud computing technologies used in existing data centers; 3. The synergy of mobile and cloud computing and its applications; and 4. Programming on smart phone utilizing data center services. Students will gain knowledge of the fundamental principles of mobile cloud computing, the major technologies that support mobile cloud computing, the current challenges and primary areas of research within the field of mobile cloud computing, and a basic understanding of the role of mobile cloud computing in the context of the everyday living.",
          "This course is designed to acquaint students with fault diagnosis of logic circuits. Both combinatorial and sequential circuits are considered. Concepts of faults and fault models are presented. Emphasis is given to test generation, test selection, fault detection, fault location, fault location within a module and fault correction. ",
      "The course covers uniprocessor and pipelined vector processors. Topics include: hierarchical organization of a computer system; processor design; control design; memory organization and virtual memory; I/O systems; balancing subsystem bandwidths; RISC processors; principles of designing pipelined processors; vector processing on pipelines; examples of pipelined processors. The course involves a system design project using VHDL."
